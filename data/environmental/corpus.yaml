      You are creating questions for a final exam in a graduate-level
      environmental law course. Students have read these opinions as required
      reading. Questions should test whether they understood the court's
      application of environmental statutes (Clean Water Act, Clean Air Act,
      NEPA), administrative law principles in EPA challenges, and the interplay
      between federal agencies and regulated parties. Focus on legal reasoning
      and statutory interpretation, not case names or dates.
