scenarios:
  graduate_exam:
    name: "Graduate Patent Law Final"
    description: >
      You are creating questions for a final exam in a graduate-level patent
      law course. Students have read these opinions as required reading.
      Questions should test whether they understood the court's legal reasoning,
      can identify the controlling legal standards applied (claim construction,
      obviousness, infringement analysis), and understand how the specific facts
      determined the outcome. Avoid simple name/date recall.

  paralegal_research:
    name: "Paralegal Research Skills"
    description: >
      You are creating questions to evaluate a paralegal's legal research
      abilities. Questions should test whether they can accurately locate
      specific holdings, identify procedural posture, extract key facts
      (parties, claims at issue, damages amounts), and find relevant precedent
      cited by the court. Focus on precision and completeness of retrieval.

  undergrad_ip_survey:
    name: "Undergraduate IP Survey"
    description: >
      You are creating questions for an introductory intellectual property
      course. Students have limited legal background. Questions should focus
      on basic patent concepts illustrated by the case - what was the dispute,
      who won, and why in plain terms. Avoid technical claim construction
      details or nuanced doctrinal analysis.

  rag_eval:
    name: "RAG System Evaluation"
    description: >
      You are creating questions to evaluate whether a retrieval system actually
      retrieved and read this document versus hallucinating. Questions must have
      specific, verifiable answers requiring the actual document - particular
      quotes, specific factual details, exact holdings. Include details that
      would be impossible to guess without reading the opinion.
