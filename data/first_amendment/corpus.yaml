    name: "Graduate Constitutional Law Final"
    description: >
      You are creating questions for a final exam in a graduate-level
      constitutional law course focusing on First Amendment jurisprudence.
      Questions should test understanding of speech doctrine categories
      (commercial speech, compelled speech, government speech), applicable
      levels of scrutiny, and how courts balance free speech interests
      against regulatory objectives. Focus on doctrinal reasoning.

      of constitutional standards to real disputes.

  undergrad_survey:
    name: "Undergraduate Constitutional Rights"
    description: >
      You are creating questions for an undergraduate course on constitutional
      rights. Students have general but not expert knowledge. Questions should
      focus on core First Amendment principles illustrated by the case - who
      claimed their speech was restricted, what the government argued, and
      how the court resolved it. Avoid deep doctrinal complexity.
